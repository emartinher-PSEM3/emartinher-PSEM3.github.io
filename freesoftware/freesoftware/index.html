<p>Nowadays the use of software in Chemical Engineering is essential for many applications, from scientific and technical calculations to the design of presentations and preparation of documents.  Currently, there are both free and proprietary alternatives to address the different tasks and challenges of the Chemical Engineering field. However  Free Software is developed under political and ethical principles which promotes the expand of the open access knowledge, making scientific research more visible and accessible. More information about Free Software and Open Access movement can be found in the Free Software Foundation and in  Free Knowledge Institute.</p>
<p>Free Software offers powerful tools which covers adequately the requirements of chemical engineers. In particular the following software can be very useful for Chemical Engineering tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Julia</li>
<li>Octave</li>
<li>Scilab</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>LibreOffice</li>
<li>Inkscape</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
<li>LibreCAD</li>
<li>FreeCAD</li>
</ul>
