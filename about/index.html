<p>I am Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering, and I am concerned with assessing and improving the sustainability of current agricultural and industrial systems. I like to work in the intersection of environmental and sustainability fields with the decision-making and optimization techniques using open source software.</p>
<p>I started my bachelor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Salamanca (USAL) (Spain) in 2011, having the chance of performing an engineering internship at Michelin S.A. Following my bachelor studies I completed my master studies USAL, spending three months at SCK-CEN (Belgium) as research intern. After a three months break for being part of LAPASSION project the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Santiago de Chile, Chile), I went back to the University of Salamanca for my Ph.D. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Université Laval (Québec, Canada).</p>
<p>My main work has dealt with the assessment of phosphorus recovery processes at livestock facilities, including the modelling of treatment processes, GIS assessment of phosphorus releases, decision-making frameworks developing, and the evaluation of incentive policies of phosphorus recovery processes deployment.</p>
